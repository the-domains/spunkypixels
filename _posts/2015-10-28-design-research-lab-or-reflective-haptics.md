description: 'This project investigates a new type of feedback for touch screen styli: frictional actuation. The proposed pen has a ball on its tip, which is connected to an electromagnetic coil. This coil serves as a brake to the ball, enabling fine-tuned control for the force required to drag the pen over the surface.'
