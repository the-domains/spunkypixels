description: 'Touch screens have been widely adopted in mobile devices. Although touch input is very flexible in that it can be used for a wide variety of applications on mobile devices, they do not provide physical affordances, encourage eyes-free use or utilize the full dexterity of our hands due to the lack of physical controls.'
