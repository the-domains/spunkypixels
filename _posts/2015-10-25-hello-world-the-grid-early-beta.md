About more than a year ago I backed this awesome project "The Grid" as one of the first founding members. I have since then been anxiously awaiting getting early beta access to The Grid. 

That happened earlier this month and today I found the time to delve into the entire thing.

I've gone through the getting started docs and as I write I'm installing the Grid iOS app on my phone. I'm super excited!
