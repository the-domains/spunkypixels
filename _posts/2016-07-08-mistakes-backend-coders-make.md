  User experience is paramount for successful websites, but backend coding is
  responsible for processing data and storing important user input for dynamic
  website responses. The best teams contain a designer and backend coder who
  together create apps that solve user problems. As a backend coder, great
  communication and interpersonal skills with designers will not only enhance an
  app, but it will also make it a success.
